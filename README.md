# Event4You

MERN type application with Redux for authorization. 
Pictures are stored on MongoDB with base64 encrypting. 
I am going to be adding further functionalities, such as commentary section, searching for tags, adding event to favourite and GoogleMaps.

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for client and server side.
